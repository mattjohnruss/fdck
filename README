Create a build directory and enter it:
mkdir build
cd build

Run cmake from within build directory
cmake <flags> ..

<flags> contains extra flags that we pass to cmake.

For an optimised build use:
<flags> = -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

To cross-compile for Windows using mingw use:
<flags> = -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=Windows -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++

Note that link-time optimisation is disabled when cross-compiling since it seems to create executables that immediately crash.

Then run
make <options> <targets>

where <targets> contains the list of drivers etc. to build (all by default), and <options> usually contains just -jN, to compile using N cpus. Add VERBOSE=1 to <options> to see exactly which commands are run by make (this is a cmake specific option).
